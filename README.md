# crossfade.lua

Crossfade is a simple, <100 LOC music management library for use with [LOVE2D](http://love2d.org). Not very many features, but it works for my needs and might work for yours as well:

- Crossfading
- General fade in/out
- Memoized loading

**NOTE:** To run the demo, you need to put mp3's in a "music/" subdirectory. Read main.lua for specifics, along with how to use the library.
